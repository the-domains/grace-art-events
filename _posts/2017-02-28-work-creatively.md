# Work Creatively for $$$

We all know that sometimes, especially when you are just getting started in your creative career, it can be challenging to keep the flow of abundance... well... flowing.

Here are some sites worth considering if you are looking to make some creative $$$

## Visual/Fine Art & Design

**Printful**- Print your art on just about anything from cushions, leggings, hats, canvas, bags, mugs, shirts and socks. Set up your designs in a shop, add your branding and Printful will fulfil your orders and ship products to your customers for you.
