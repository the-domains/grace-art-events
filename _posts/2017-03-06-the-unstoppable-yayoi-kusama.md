  IT'S HARDLY TOKYO'S most inspiring area, but here in Shinjuku ward, amid a
  shambolic jumble of low-rise housing, is where artist Yayoi Kusama keeps her
  fastidiously maintained studio: an elegantly unadorned concrete building that
  strikes a conspicuous note in the otherwise nondescript quarter. Almost every
  day, she comes here to paint from 9 a.m.
