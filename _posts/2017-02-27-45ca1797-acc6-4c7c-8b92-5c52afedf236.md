Come and join in one of our untutored life drawing sessions. BYO paper and drawing materials. Poses starting at 1 minute and work up to 15-20 minute poses. Drawers of all levels welcome.

Wednesday's sessions alternate fortnightly between traditional nude life drawing sessions and costume sessions- with burlesque performers, circus performers, musicians, actors, designers and artists as our models. Come and meet, draw and chat to some of Brisbane's best local creative talent.

Thursday sessions are always nude.
