  From a superficial viewpoint, seeing the human body up close and personal in
  all its glory (or lack thereof) is a confrontational concept for some (which
  explains why you don't see many people walking around naked in public on a
  daily basis I suppose) but why are we so fascinated by the human form when it
  is expressed so liberally in art?
