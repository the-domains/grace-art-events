            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What Doctors Can Learn From Looking at Art</h1><p>Therein lies the significance of learning through art: It is subtle and indirect, yet it ingrains insights deep within your consciousness.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why Creativity has Nothing to Do With &apos;Being Creative&apos;</h1><p>As a child, creative thinking seems to come naturally. There&apos;s no fear of being &apos;wrong&apos;, no expectation of what we&apos;ll produce and no pressure to produce it - when we create as children, we allow our most authentic selves come to life and with that, our most creative, innovative ideas arrive.</p><img src="http://collectivehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/COLLECTIVE-HUB_ISSUE-42.jpeg"></article>]]></description>
